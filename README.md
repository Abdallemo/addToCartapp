# Add To Cart App

## Overview
This is my first web application that uses Firebase for backend support. The app demonstrates a basic "Add to Cart" functionality, 
showcasing the integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a Firebase database. This project is a stepping stone for my future web development projects.

## Features

User Interface: Simple and intuitive design using HTML and CSS.
Cart Functionality: Add items to the cart with a single click.
Firebase Integration: Store and retrieve cart data using Firebase.
Real-Time Updates: Automatically updates the cart in real-time.

## Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the web page.
CSS: For styling the web page.
JavaScript: For implementing the add to cart functionality and interacting with Firebase.
Firebase: For backend services including database and authentication.

## What I've Learned
This project was a valuable learning experience for me. I learned how to:

Integrate a web application with a database.
Use Firebase for real-time data storage and retrieval.
Structure a web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

## Future Improvements
- [x] ~~User Authentication: Add user authentication to allow users to save their cart between sessions.~~
- [x] ~~Enhanced UI/UX: Improve the design and usability of the app.~~
- [ ] Additional Features: Implement features such as item quantity management, total price calculation, and checkout process.
